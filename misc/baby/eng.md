**_If you’d like to give something to little Gino, this page is here to help._**

Our son **Gino Leone Iannillo** is growing up surrounded by love, and we’re incredibly grateful for the people in his life.  
If you’d like to mark a birthday, a visit, or a special moment with a gift (never an obligation), we’ve gathered a couple of simple options that work well over time.

*(We try to keep things intentional and avoid random toys — space is limited, and we prefer useful, meaningful items 💙)*

### 🎁 CHOOSE A GIFT  
We keep an Amazon wishlist updated with items Gino can use as he grows — practical things, books, and a few carefully chosen surprises.

👉 [Amazon Wishlist for Gino](https://www.amazon.de/baby-reg/antonioken-iannillo-martina-florio-november-2025-luxembourg/2HPEPP4JMTXGT)

Items are delivered directly to our home, making it easy for everyone.

### 🧩 SUPPORT GINO’S PLAY & LEARNING  
We also love toys and materials that support learning through play. One of our favorites are the **Lovevery** boxes, which are designed to grow with children over time.

If you’d like to contribute to this idea, you can do so here:

👉 [Contribute via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate?campaign_id=V6HKGDTHFH7MC)

Contributions are used over time for age-appropriate Lovevery boxes and similar learning materials.

## Thank you 💙

We truly appreciate every kind thought, message, and gesture.  
More than anything, we’re thankful that Gino is growing up surrounded by caring and generous people.

With love,  
**Antonio & Martina**
