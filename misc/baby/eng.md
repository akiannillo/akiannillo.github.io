**_Check this page if you want to send a little something for our baby on the way!_**

As many of you know, we are expecting a baby — and the excitement is sky-high!  
If you’d like to give us a gift (of course, no obligation at all!), we’ve prepared two simple and helpful options:

### 🎁 CHOOSE A GIFT  
We’ve created an Amazon wishlist with some things we need for the first months of our little one.

👉 [Amazon Baby Wishlist](https://www.amazon.de/baby-reg/antonioken-iannillo-martina-florio-november-2025-luxembourg/2HPEPP4JMTXGT)

Gifts will be shipped directly to our home, so it’s all very easy. Every thought is greatly appreciated!

### 🧩 HELP BUILD OUR TOY COLLECTION  
Another idea we really love are the **Lovevery** boxes, which contain educational toys and beautiful items designed to accompany the baby’s growth month by month.

If you prefer to contribute to this collective gift, you can use the button below to make a small donation:

👉 [Donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate?campaign_id=V6HKGDTHFH7MC)

Every contribution will be used to purchase Lovevery boxes as our baby grows.

## Thank you from the bottom of our hearts 💙

We are deeply grateful for all the love, support, and enthusiasm you have shown us.  
The greatest gift, in any case, is knowing that our baby will grow up surrounded by wonderful people like you.

With love,  
**Antonio&Martina**
