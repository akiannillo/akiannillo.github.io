I got my PhD two years ago, and now I can say that all my work is published on journals.
Today, the last contribution of my thesis is available on _Empirical Software Engineering Journal_!

Our paper is named **A comprehensive study on software aging across android versions and vendors**.

It analyzes the software aging phenomenon in Android Operating Systems, and it provides an extensive methodology to study it in newer versions and devices. During my PhD, I found interesting results for Android Lollipop, Marshmallow, and Nougat.

Enjoy the reading.
