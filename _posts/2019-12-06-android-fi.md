Finally, after almost 2 years from my Ph.D. defense, the publication on one of my thesis contributions arrived on _IEEE Transactions on Reliability_!

Our paper **Dependability Assessment of the Android OS Through Fault Injection** is available on IEEE Xplore.

It describes the design of AndroFIT, a fault injection tool that we use to inject a realistic fault model in the Android OS. This model was constructed through systematic guidelines we created for mobile OS and applied to Android. The large fault injection campaign unveiled very interesting results.

Enjoy the reading.
