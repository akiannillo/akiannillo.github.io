It's been a while since I've written on this blog, but I wanted to share something personal with you all. Recently, I've been feeling overwhelmed with everything in my life. Between work, family, and trying to maintain a social life, there need to be more hours in the day.

But something nice came out recently... I am thrilled to share with you all that I have officially incorporated my first startup, WAVY MEET S.Ã  r.l. It has been a long journey to get to this point, but I am excited to see where this new venture takes me.

For those who don't know, WAVY MEET is a digital rehabilitation platform that brings cardiac rehab to your own home. Developed using mature technologies and based on requirements and specifications collected from national and international cardio rehabilitation experts, WAVY MEET is a platform featuring video conference software with real-time and secure transfer of vital signs.

It allows caretakers to connect with their patients remotely and aims to support medical centers that offer CR programs. With WAVY MEET, patients can receive the care they need from the comfort of their own home.

Further, WAVY MEET is currently part of the FIT4STARTS program of Luxinnovation!
For those of you who may not be familiar with FIT4STARTS, it is a renowned startup acceleration program that provides support and resources to help startups grow and thrive. Being a part of this program means that we have access to invaluable mentorship, networking opportunities, and funding to help us take WAVY MEET to the next level.

Of course, starting a business is never easy, and I know that there will be challenges along the way. But I am committed to making WAVY MEET a success, and I am grateful for all the support and encouragement I have received so far.
