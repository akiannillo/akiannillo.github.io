Months ago, I prepared together with Wazen SHBAIR and Denisa SUSTALOVA a proposal for the _FNR POC_ call.

We wanted to create a platform to help physical therapists and people with cardiovascular diseases get the most out of remote rehabilitation sessions.
Now, I'm happy to announce that we got this grant, and from January, we'll start this fantastic project.
It's my first experience in the entrepreneurial world, but I have a team that supports me and will allow me to follow my research projects simultaneously.

You can consult the official results and a brief project description [here](https://www.fnr.lu/results-2021-jump21-call/).
