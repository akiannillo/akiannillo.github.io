# present me

I'm currently working as a Research Scientist at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust ([SnT](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt)), University of Luxembourg, in the SEDAN group headed by [Prof. Radu State](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/people/radu_state).

My research activities focus on software dependability and security, especially software verification and assessment. 
Currently, my research targets include new and innovative technologies such as **ARM Trustzone for Cortex-M**, **Ethereum Smart Contract**, and **ROS**. 
I am engaged in providing concrete and easy-to-use methodologies and tools that could help industries and open-source communities to provide software that can be trusted. 
The challenges arise from the nature of modern systems, complex and fragmented, that makes actual acceptance criteria for non-functional requirements incomplete or hard to apply in practice.

I'm the principal investigator of the project _"SecuriTy Assessment of tRusTzone-m based Software"_ ([STARTS](https://starts.uni.lu/)) funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund under the programme Junion CORE. STARTS project aims to create a methodology for the security assessment of software based on TrustZone-M technology and a novel verification and validation framework to implement this methodology. The project will start in 2020, tutored by prof. Radu Sion, and **I'm actively looking for Ph.D. students and post-doc researchers** to fill some project positions. Mail me if interested.

I'm involved in the management of the European H2020 project [CONCORDIA](https://www.concordia-h2020.eu/), a dedicated consortium leading the integration of Europe's cybersecurity competencies in a network of expertise to build the European secure, resilient, and trusted ecosystem.

# past me

I got my PhD in Information Technologies and Electrical Engineering ([ITEE](http://dottorato-itee.dieti.unina.it/index.php/en/)), at the University of Naples Federico II ([UniNa](http://www.unina.it/home)).
My PhD tutors were [prof. Domenico Cotroneo](http://wpage.unina.it/cotroneo/Domenico_Cotroneo/Home.html), and [Dr. Roberto Natella](http://wpage.unina.it/roberto.natella/). 
During my PhD course, I was a visiting scholar at Northeastern University, Boston, USA,for the academic year 2016/2017, tutored by [prof. Cristina Nita-Rotaru](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/crisn/).

I'm a contributor to the [FÐ¯IDA](https://frida.re/) tool project: more precisely, to the low-level code instrumentation library frida-gum.
